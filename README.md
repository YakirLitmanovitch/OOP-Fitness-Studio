# Fitness Studio

## Description
This project is developed using Java and Python, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and various design patterns to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase. The system is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing user data, processing information, generating reports, and sending notifications. 📊📧

## Features
- **User Management**: Allows for the creation, updating, and deletion of user accounts. 👤
- **Data Processing**: Handles the processing and analysis of data inputs. 📈
- **Reporting**: Generates various reports based on the processed data. 📝
- **Notification**: Sends notifications to users based on specific events or triggers. 🔔

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The project follows OOP principles, which include:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object.
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones, promoting code reusability.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.

## Design Patterns
The project utilizes several design patterns to solve common software design problems:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Observer Pattern**: Allows an object to notify other objects about changes in its state, promoting a loose coupling between objects.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.

## System Functionality
The system provides the following functionalities:

- **User Management**: 
  - Create, update, and delete user accounts.
  - Manage user roles and permissions.
  - Authenticate and authorize users.

- **Data Processing**: 
  - Import and export data in various formats.
  - Perform data validation and transformation.
  - Analyze data to extract meaningful insights.

- **Reporting**: 
  - Generate detailed reports based on user activity and data analysis.
  - Customize report templates and formats.
  - Schedule automated report generation and distribution.

- **Notification**: 
  - Send email and SMS notifications to users.
  - Configure notification triggers based on specific events.
  - Track notification delivery and read status.

- **Secretary Functionality**:
  - **Schedule Management**: Create, update, and delete appointments and meetings. 📅
  - **Contact Management**: Maintain a directory of contacts, including adding, updating, and deleting contact information. 📇
  - **Task Management**: Assign and track tasks, set deadlines, and monitor progress. ✅
  - **Document Management**: Upload, organize, and share documents with other users. 📂
  - **Communication**: Send and receive messages within the system, and manage email correspondence. ✉️

### User Management Features

- **Create User Accounts**: 
  - Allows administrators to create new user accounts by providing necessary details such as username, password, email, and role. 🆕
  - Ensures that the username is unique and validates the email format. ✅

- **Update User Accounts**: 
  - Enables users to update their profile information, including changing their password, email, and other personal details. 🔄
  - Administrators can update user roles and permissions. 🛠️

- **Delete User Accounts**: 
  - Provides functionality for administrators to delete user accounts that are no longer needed. 🗑️
  - Ensures that all associated data is properly handled or archived before deletion. 📦

- **Manage User Roles and Permissions**: 
  - Allows administrators to define and assign roles to users, such as admin, editor, viewer, etc. 🏷️
  - Configures permissions for each role to control access to different parts of the system. 🔐

- **Authenticate and Authorize Users**: 
  - Implements secure login mechanisms to authenticate users based on their credentials. 🔑
  - Uses role-based access control (RBAC) to authorize users and restrict access to specific functionalities based on their roles. 🚦
